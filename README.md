📊 Task 1: Exploring and Visualizing a Simple Dataset
✨ Objective
The goal of this task is to practice basic data exploration and visualization techniques using the Iris dataset. By completing this task, you will gain practical experience in loading data, inspecting its structure, generating summary statistics, and visualizing different aspects of the dataset to better understand its trends and distributions.

📁 Dataset
Dataset: sales dataset

Format: CSV file or loaded directly from seaborn’s built-in datasets.

Description: Contains 150 samples of iris flowers with four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) and a species label (setosa, versicolor, or virginica).

✅ Steps Completed
Load the Dataset

Loaded the Iris dataset using pandas 

Inspect the Dataset

Printed the shape of the dataset.

Displayed column names and previewed the first few rows.

Used .info() to view data types and check for missing values.

Used .describe() to see summary statistics for numerical columns.

Visualize the Dataset

Scatter Plots: Visualized relationships between different feature pairs (e.g., petal length vs. petal width) colored by species.

Histograms: Plotted histograms for each feature to observe value distributions.

Box Plots: Created box plots to identify potential outliers and compare feature distributions across species.

Tools Used

pandas: For data loading and inspection.

seaborn: For high-level visualizations.

matplotlib: For additional customization and plotting.
